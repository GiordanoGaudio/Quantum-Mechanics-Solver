# Quantum-Mechanics-Solver
A package to quickly check your calculations from any quantum mechanics class.

This is just a fun little project I developped when I was taking quantum 1. Given any potential (in functional form)
it can quickly numerically solve the Schrodinger equation

Future Goals:

-Time dependent solutions and animated graphs

-2D solver

-3D solver
